# This **is** a _heading_

There is some regular text going on here
now and there will be _italics_ and **bold**
stuff.

## There will be exposition and quotes

There will be gobbldy gook written that will pass down the 
ages, improving the lot of no one. Not once. Not ever.

So sayeth:

> That shit _Jay_ said?
> That was some **bullshit**.
> Maddening, it is.

## There will be lists

- An **unordered** list item
- _Another_ unordered list item

## There may be numbered lists

1. Item 1
2. **Item** 2
3. Item **3**
4. Item 4

## Some code

```
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
	printf("Hello, World!\n");
	return 0;
}
```

And a final plain, text paragraph.
